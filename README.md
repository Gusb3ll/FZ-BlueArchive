Blue Archive graphics for Flipper Zero

## Usage

- Clone this repository

- Move the graphics in the `dist/asset_packs` folder into your own graphic folders in your flipper

## Disclaimer

- This is built for XTreme firmware so the folder structure is built like this.
- You can still use it will others firm but some files/folders needed to be move first

## Note

I will continue to add other students if I have time to spare
